title: "For undergraduate students"
---

In its initial phase during 2022, ENGINmakers has funding to employ two undergraduate students, working under the supervision of [Dr. Daniel Gallichan](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/view/507850-gallichan-daniel), to each spend up to ~100 hours over the period of June to September 2022 working on the development of two engineering-focused activities for use with school visits and public engagement. 

The planned timeline is to have two visits to a local school ([Willows High School](https://www.willowshigh.co.uk/)), the first in July and the second in September. This will allow a first activity to be tested in July, with feedback acted upon in the development of the second activity in September. In collaboration with [Mr Speight Consultancy](https://www.mrspeightconsultancy.com/) these activities will also be converted into 'teacher packs' to allow schoolteachers to conduct versions of these activities independently, supporting their deliver of the Curriculum for Wales.

This pilot project also has support from [The micro:bit Foundation](https://microbit.org/about/) to provide consultation on optimising our use of the features of the micro:bit, as well as support from [MathWorks](https://uk.mathworks.com/) who we aim to collaborate with in ensuring that MATLAB is also able to interface smoothly with the micro:bit in the development of these activities.
