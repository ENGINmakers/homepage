title: "For undergraduate students"
---

In its initial phase during 2022, ENGINmakers had funding to employ two undergraduate students, working under the supervision of [Dr. Daniel Gallichan](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/view/507850-gallichan-daniel), to each spend up to ~100 hours over the period of June to September 2022 working on the development of two engineering-focused activities for use with school visits and public engagement. 

We had two visits to local schools, the first in July and the second in November, and developed two separate activities to conduct during those visits. In collaboration with [Mr Speight Consultancy](https://www.mrspeightconsultancy.com/) these activities have been converted into 'teacher packs' to allow schoolteachers to conduct versions of these activities independently, supporting their deliver of the Curriculum for Wales.

This pilot project also had support from [The micro:bit Foundation](https://microbit.org/about/) to provide consultation on optimising our use of the features of the micro:bit, as well as support from [MathWorks](https://uk.mathworks.com/) who collaborated with ensuring that MATLAB is also able to interface smoothly with the micro:bit in the development of these activities.

Feel free to [contact me via email](mailto:gallichand@cardiff.ac.uk) if you have any questions or would like to get involved in the future is such activities.
