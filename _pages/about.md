I'm a lecturer in Medical Imaging at Cardiff University - and you can read more about the research that I'm involved in on [my University webpage](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/view/507850-gallichan-daniel).

ENGINmakers has started in 2022 as a project to support the Civic Mission of Cardiff University, and initially received funding to engage two students to create two 'activities' that support teachers and primary/seconday pupils in their learning of coding concepts, and the relevance of coding to applications such as those found in Engineering.
